# Map Sellers

This page is a repository that's part of [Awesome-FoundryVTT](https://github.com/SquareBottle/Awesome-FoundryVTT). It only contains ready-to-use map sellers made specifically to integrate with [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) (walls, dynamic lighting, etc).

#### Design Goals

1. Be a centralized listing of as many map sellers as possible
2. Only include map sellers who make maps specifically tailored to Foundry VTT
3. Provide as much of a "window shopping" experience as possible
4. Present the map sellers in a uniform, simple manner
5. Only use images that allow for apples-to-apples comparisons

#### Contributing

If you are not a map seller but you've found one that isn't listed anywhere on this page, then [create an Issue](https://github.com/SquareBottle/Awesome-FoundryVTT/issues) to tell us. But please do two things first:

1. Doublecheck to make sure it _really_ isn't listed anywhere.
2. Doublecheck to make sure that the seller makes maps that are designed _specifically_ to integrate with Foundry VTT. It should say so somewhere on their website/Patreon/whatever. When you create an issue, please link to where we can see this for ourselves.

If you're a map seller and would like to be listed in the **Authorized** section, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/SquareBottle/Awesome-FoundryVTT/issues) â€“ but be ready to prove that you are indeed who you say you are! Awesome-FoundryVTT is new enough that we don't yet have a preferred way of doing this, so feel free to propose something. Here are a couple ideas:

- Provide an email address that uses your storefront's web domain. You'll be contacted ASAP. Reply to confirm.
- Add a note about this page somewhere publicly visible on your storefront, like at the end of a blog post. Link us to where we can see it.

## Authorized

The sellers on this table have given us things like thumbnails that link to full-size screenshots, which are essential for the "window shopping" goal. There might even be demos and discount codes. (Demos that can be used without restriction will be marked with asterisks because everyone likes freebies.) Authorized entries are maintained by the sellers themselves.

| Mapmaker | Thumbnail | Demo | Commissions | Price | Discount |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| [Example Seller](https://google.com) | [![Thumbnail](https://dummyimage.com/250x200/d4d4d4/ffffff.png "Alt text")](https://dummyimage.com/1920x1280/d4d4d4/ffffff.png&text=Direct+link+to+full-size+screenshot) | [Yes](https://google.com) | No | $5/month; $50/year | "AWESOME" for 10% off |

## Unauthorized

These entries lack the kinds of things that a seller would need to give permission to upload, precisely because we have not obtained that permission. Unauthorized entries are not maintained by the sellers, so please let us know if there's any link rot.

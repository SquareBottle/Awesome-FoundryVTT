# Map Sellers

This is a repository of ready-to-use map sellers made specifically to integrate with Foundry VTT (walls, dynamic lighting, etc). It is part of [Awesome-FoundryVTT](https://github.com/SquareBottle/Awesome-FoundryVTT).

#### Design Goals

1. Be a centralized listing of as many map sellers as possible
2. Only include map sellers who make maps specifically tailored to Foundry VTT
3. Provide as much of a "window shopping" experience as possible
4. Present the map sellers in a uniform, simple manner
5. Only use images that allow for apples-to-apples comparisons

# Directory

By necessity, this directory is divided into two groups. The difference is that **Group A** entries have thumbnails that link to full-size screenshots, and might even have demos and discount codes. They are added and maintained by the sellers themselves (but must adhere to the rest of the page's formatting). **Group B** entries are just more than links to storefronts. They lack the kinds of things that a seller would need to give permission to upload, precisely because we have not obtained that permission.

## Group A

| Mapmaker | Thumbnail | Demo | Commissions | Price | Discount |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| [Example Seller](https://google.com) | - ![Thumbnail](https://dummyimage.com/250x200/d4d4d4/ffffff.png "Alt text") | [Yes](https://google.com) | No | $5/month; $50/year | "AWESOME" for 10% off |


## Group B

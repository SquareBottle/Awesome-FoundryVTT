# Map Sellers

This is a repository of ready-to-use map sellers made specifically to integrate with Foundry VTT (walls, dynamic lighting, etc). It is part of [Awesome-FoundryVTT](https://github.com/SquareBottle/Awesome-FoundryVTT).

#### Design Goals

1. Be a centralized listing of as many map sellers as possible
2. Only include map sellers who make maps specifically tailored to Foundry VTT
3. Provide as much of a "window shopping" experience as possible
4. Present the map sellers in a uniform, simple manner
5. Only use images that allow for apples-to-apples comparisons

## Authorized

The sellers on this table have given us things like thumbnails that link to full-size screenshots, which are essential for the "window shopping" goal. There might even be demos and discount codes. (Demos that can be used without restriction will be marked with asterisks because everyone likes freebies.) Authorized entries are maintained by the sellers themselves.

| Mapmaker | Thumbnail | Demo | Commissions | Price | Discount |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| [Example Seller](https://google.com) | [![Thumbnail](https://dummyimage.com/250x200/d4d4d4/ffffff.png "Alt text")](https://dummyimage.com/1920x1280/d4d4d4/ffffff.png&text=Direct+link+to+full-size+screenshot) | [Yes](https://google.com) | No | $5/month; $50/year | "AWESOME" for 10% off |

## Unauthorized

These entries lack the kinds of things that a seller would need to give permission to upload, precisely because we have not obtained that permission. Unauthorized entries are not maintained by the sellers, so please let us know if there's any link rot.
